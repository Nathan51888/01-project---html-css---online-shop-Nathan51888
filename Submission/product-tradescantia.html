              This beautiful green, pink, and white striped plant is easy to
              care for and also easy to propagate! This cross-pollinated variety
              originated from the Netherlands. We are selling them in this
              petite size, but they are fast growers. The more light it gets,
              the more vibrant the color will be, so give this plant some good
              light. Some temporary direct sun is great! The plant you receive
              may be in either ceramic pot design, but you may request one in
              checkout notes and we will do our best to accommodate.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Light:</strong> Bright, indirect sunlight or full sun</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Water:</strong> Water when the top inch of the soil is
              dry. Be careful not to overwater.
